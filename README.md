# omnifood/zenchef

Zenchef for [glitchr/omnifood](https://github.com/glitchr-studio/omnifood) - its place, not yet its
calls: **Zenchef's partner API is documented on request only.** Its help centre
(https://help.zenchef.com/hc/en-gb/articles/27690768125597-Zenchef-API, read on 2026-10-04) lists what
it offers - reservations read, created, updated and their status changed; availability and opening
hours read; guests; one webhook per restaurant on a reservation made or updated - but neither its
address, nor its paths, fields, statuses, nor how a webhook is signed.

> **Not verified against the live API (non vérifié en réel)**, and nothing guessed: every
> reservation call throws `NotSupportedException` until the documentation is in hand.

```php
use Omnifood\Zenchef\ZenchefPlatformFactory;
use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttpClient;

$zenchef = (new ZenchefPlatformFactory(HttpClient::create()))->create([
    'token' => getenv('ZENCHEF_TOKEN') ?: null,                  // Settings > Partners: "Zenchef token"
    'restaurant_id' => getenv('ZENCHEF_RESTAURANT_ID') ?: null,  // Settings > Partners
    'base_uri' => getenv('ZENCHEF_BASE_URI') ?: null,            // from Zenchef's documentation
    'headers' => [],                                             // from it too: ['<header>' => '{token}', '<header>' => '{restaurant_id}']
]);
```

Plain PHP, no framework needed: the factory takes any `HttpClientInterface` - the application's, a
`MockHttpClient` in a test - and makes its own when given none. In a Symfony application, the same
options under `omnifood.platforms` ([the bundle](https://github.com/glitchr-studio/omnifood/blob/1.x/docs/symfony.md)):

```yaml
omnifood:
    platforms:
        zenchef:
            factory: zenchef
            options:
                token: '%env(default::ZENCHEF_TOKEN)%'                  # Settings > Partners: "Zenchef token"
                restaurant_id: '%env(default::ZENCHEF_RESTAURANT_ID)%'  # Settings > Partners
                base_uri: ~                                             # from Zenchef's documentation
                headers: {}                                             # from it too: {"<header>": "{token}", "<header>": "{restaurant_id}"}
```

## What it does

- Holds the restaurant's credentials and a client, `api()`, that sends the configured headers
  (`{token}` and `{restaurant_id}` replaced) to the configured address - the calls to write once
  Zenchef's documentation says them.
- `capabilities()`.

## Left in NotSupportedException

Everything of `ReservationsInterface` and `NotifiableInterface` - `reservations()`, `reservation()`,
`createReservation()`, `updateReservation()`, `cancelReservation()`, `setStatus()`, `notify()` - for
want of a public documentation; `pushAvailability()` because Zenchef's help centre lists reading
availability, not writing it.

Zenchef's published rules, for when it is written: 100 calls a minute for the calls answered in
less than a second, the slower ones one after the other; pages of 250 to 500; after a first full
import, only what changed since the last call.

## What it takes

- The restaurant on Zenchef's **Grow** subscription (or a special agreement).
- The restaurant asks **help@zenchef.com** (or api-tech-help@zenchef.com) for the **API
  documentation** and, if wanted, a **demo restaurant** on the pre-production environment, giving
  its `restaurantId` and the use.
- Its **token** and **restaurant id**: Zenchef, Settings > Partners.
